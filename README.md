# To-Do List Application

A full-stack to-do list application with REST API backend and modern web frontend.

## Project Structure

This project consists of two main components:

### Backend API
RESTful API with the following endpoints (see GitHub issues #2-#6):
- `GET /v1/tasks` - List tasks with filtering and pagination
- `GET /v1/tasks/{id}` - Get single task by ID
- `POST /v1/tasks` - Create new task
- `PATCH /v1/tasks/{id}` - Update existing task
- `DELETE /v1/tasks/{id}` - Delete task

### Frontend Web Application
Modern, responsive web interface for task management. See [FRONTEND_ISSUE.md](./FRONTEND_ISSUE.md) for detailed requirements and specifications.

## Development Roadmap

1. **Backend Development** - Issues #2-#6 (API endpoints)
2. **MCP Integration** - Issue #1 (Claude Desktop integration)
3. **Frontend Development** - See [FRONTEND_ISSUE.md](./FRONTEND_ISSUE.md)
